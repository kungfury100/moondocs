## Approach

Typography system is structured using design tokens, available as variables in both Figma and CSS libraries. These tokens are integrated throughout the entire design system and form a foundational layer. Typography system can be categorized into:
- **Tokens:** Individual tokens representing various text properties.
- **Styles:** Tokens combined into named and reusable styles, applied directly to UI elements.

## Tokens

### Primitive tokens

These are raw, foundational and context-agnostic values, such as font sizes, families, weights or line heights.

Use these tokens when building new semantic or scale-based tokens. In some cases they can be used directly to create text styles.

Example of primitive tokens:

```css
--text-16: 16px;
--space-24: 24px;
--font-weight-regular: 400;
--font-family-primary: "DM Sans", sans-serif;
```

### Semantic tokens

These tokens apply meaning and intent to combinations of primitive tokens. They also represent specific typographic roles, such as body, heading and labels.

This abstraction allows you to update underlying primitive values (e.g. font-size) without changing the component logic.

Example of semantic tokens:

```css
--body-400-font-size: var(--text-16);
--body-400-line-height: var(--space-24);
--body-400-font-weight: var(--font-weight-regular);
--body-400-font-family: var(--font-family-primary);
```

### Scale tokens

Scale tokens base on relative size instead of purpose. Many components in Moon Design System have different sizes (`sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl` etc). Scale tokens are created to be reused across those components and layouts, providing consistent sizing.

Scale-based tokens are especially useful in component systems where multiple components (inputs, buttons, tags etc) share similar sizes are consistent sizing is required.

Example of scale tokens:

```css
--lg-font-size: var(--body-400-font-size);
--lg-line-height: var(--body-400-line-height);
--lg-font-weight: var(--body-400-font-weight);
--lg-font-family: var(--body-400-font-family);
```

## Styles

Typography styles are built by combining individual tokens into composite tokens. These styles are applied directly to UI elements, ensuring consistent appearance.

Anatomy of a text style:

| **Property**          | **Token**                 | **Value**
|---------------------  |---------------------------|----------------
| Font-size             | `--body-400-font-size`    | 16px
| Line-height           | `--body-400-line-height`  | 24px
| Font-family           | `--body-400-font-weight`  | Regular
| Font-weight           | `--body-400-font-family`  | DM Sans, sans-serif

### Semantic styles

Moon Design System provides a defined set of `body` and `heading` styles for general text content. Each style is structured into a five-step scale (100â€“500), progressing in size.

List of semantic text styles:

```bash
  Body/100
  Body/200
  Body/300
  Body/400
  Body/500
  Heading/100
  Heading/200
  Heading/300
  Heading/400
  Heading/500
```

These styles are mapped directly to content-level usage such as paragraphs, section titles, headings and rich text blocks.

### Scale-based styles

For components that follow t-shirt sizing, Moon includes scale-based styles. These are not tied to semantic meaning, but instead offer consistent sizing tokens usable across various components.

```bash
  Label/Sm
  Label/Md
  Label/Lg
  Label/Xl
```
